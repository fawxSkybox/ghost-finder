    "info-text": "<p>Phasmophobia is a psycho-horror game with online co-op for up to 4 players in which you and your team of paranormal investigators enter haunted locations and collect as much evidence of the paranormal as possible. However, sometimes you miss things or clues and that's where this little helper, the Ghost Finder, comes in.</p><p>You select the evidence you have and perhaps you were also able to pay a little attention to the movement profile or other clues of your ghost, then you can also select these options at the same time and find out more quickly which ghost is up to mischief!</p><p>Below you will find a range of filter options; you can both activate a filter as well as exclude the proof with a further click in the checkbox - just as it works in the game.</p><p>You can also get more information about each filter by hovering over it with the mouse and for each ghost by clicking on the info-icon.</p><p>Enjoy! o/</p>",
