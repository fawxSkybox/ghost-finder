However, sometimes you miss things or clues and that's where this little helper, the Ghost Finder, comes in.</p><p>You select the evidence you have and perhaps you were also able to pay a little attention to the movement profile or other clues of your ghost, then you can also select these options at the same time and find out more quickly which ghost is up to mischief!</p><p>Below you will find a range of filter options; you can both activate a filter as well as exclude the proof with a further click in the checkbox - just as it works in the game.</p><p>You can also get more information about each filter by hovering over it with the mouse and for each ghost by clicking on the info-icon.</p><p>Enjoy! o/</p>",

The last way to escape is by lighting incense sticks, which will cause the ghost to wander around for a few seconds, during which time you can get out of its field of vision and hide. To make this easier, you should close doors behind you if possible or go around corners.",

    "ghosts.raiju.description.tipp": "The Raiju can be easily identified by paying attention to its speed during the chase, especially on small maps, as long as there are active electronic items nearby. If the ghost continues to move very fast while roaming (and is not chasing specific players), it is most likely a Raiju.",

    "ghosts.obake.description.tipp": "Each handprint of an obake can have five or six fingers. The number of fingers can vary, even if the obake touches the same surface several times. Since the handprint with six fingers is unique to an Obake, it can uniquely identify it. However, a palm print with five fingers does not necessarily rule out an obake.",

    "ghosts.mimic.description.tipp": "The Mimic's ability to mimic other spirits allows it to have every ability of every spirit. Theoretically every 30 seconds. The safest way to play is to treat the ghost as if it had all abilities at the same time, as you can never be sure how long it will mimic a ghost. And it is not always immediately obvious which ghost it is imitating.",

    "ghosts.moroi.description.tipp": "Given the Moroi's ability to lose their minds after answering through the Spirit box, it is recommended that the Spirit box not be used after the first answer. If necessary, only the player who previously asked questions should check the evidence, and other players should stay away while asking questions.",

    "ghosts.thaye.description.tipp": "With a Thaye, both interactions and events will be more frequent from the start of the investigation, which can make it easier to locate the ghost. On the other hand, if players don't locate the ghost quickly, especially on large maps, the Thaye can quickly reach the threshold of being able to hunt and start chasing, making it potentially as aggressive as (and possibly mistaken for) a demon.",
